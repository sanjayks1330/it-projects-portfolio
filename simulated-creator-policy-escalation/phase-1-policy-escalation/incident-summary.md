## üìå Incident Overview

- **Incident Type:** Policy Misconfiguration & Over-Privilege Risk
- **Date Detected:** 28-05-2025
- **Simulated User Affected:** `creator.user@sanjaytech.io`
- **Organizational Unit:** `/ContentCreators`

## üîç Key Risk Factors

| Risk Area                    | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Org Unit Policy Gap         | Lacked proper access control enforcement (e.g., sharing, app restrictions). |
| IAM Role Assignment          | Creator user assigned broad Viewer/Editor GCP roles.                        |
| OAuth & Marketplace Access  | No app access restrictions, allowing risky third-party integrations.        |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Corrective Actions (Simulated)

- Created `/ContentCreators` OU in Admin Console.
- Reviewed user profile for `creator.user@sanjaytech.io`.
- Documented the risk and planned policy corrections.
- Phase 2 will simulate endpoint and sharing policy enforcement.

## üß† Lessons & Next Steps
