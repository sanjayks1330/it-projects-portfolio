## üö© Simulated Policy Violations

| Action Attempted                         | Expected Policy Block | Actual Result            |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Installed OAuth App (YT Tracker)        | Block unauthorized app | ‚ùå App installed allowed  |
| Shared Drive File Publicly              | Restrict public links  | ‚ùå Link sharing allowed   |
| Sent External Email                     | Block external email   | ‚ùå Email sent successfully |

## üß† Lessons Simulated

- OAuth App control policy is not yet enforced at the Org Unit level.
- Drive sharing controls are insufficient for restricted user groups.
- External email restrictions were not applied to `/ContentCreators`.
- 2-Step Verification enforcement **was successful** ‚Äî blocked login due to missing 2FA.

---

## üìå Recommendations

- Enforce Context-Aware Access and Device-Based login restrictions.
- Add `/ContentCreators` to restricted sharing groups in Drive settings.
- Apply OAuth App allowlist to limit unauthorized third-party tools.
- Monitor policy logs and alerts in the Admin console.
